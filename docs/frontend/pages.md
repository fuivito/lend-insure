# Pages

The app includes several routed pages. Not all are strictly public APIs, but examples below show how to use them and which components/hooks they compose.

Key pages:

- `src/pages/StartPage.tsx`
- `src/pages/Index.tsx`
- `src/pages/NotFound.tsx`
- `src/pages/customer/*`
- `src/pages/broker/*`
- `src/pages/onboarding/*`

Examples:

```startLine:endLine:filepath
1:35:src/pages/StartPage.tsx
```

```startLine:endLine:filepath
1:60:src/pages/customer/CustomerDashboard.tsx
```

```startLine:endLine:filepath
1:80:src/pages/broker/BrokerDashboard.tsx
```

```startLine:endLine:filepath
1:40:src/pages/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx
```
